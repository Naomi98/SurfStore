A third answer has been that we should give up teaching the research paper altogether because it bears little relationship to the writing that students are asked to do in other courses. Yet students are often required to write papers based on research, and the strategies appropriate for these papers are easy
enough to recognize-and to make part of research paper instruction in composi- tion courses.
As we see it, the first step in a satisfactory answer to the research paper problem is to recognize the considerable difference between the way students view the research paper (and have been taught to view it) and the way most college instructors and other researchers view it. The second step is to begin to base research paper instruction on a sound understanding of the features of academic research writing, features that characterize the professional writing of most college instructors and that form a model that instructors rely on-often unconsciously-to evaluate student papers. We became acutely aware of differing views of the research paper when we interviewed instructors and students about their views of the research process, the aims of research, the forms of research writing, and the appropriate evalua- tion standards for academic research papers. The responses revealed not only the differences in outlook of the novice and the professional, but also substan- tially different attitudes towards the research process and the aim, forms, and audience of the research paper. These contradictory perspectives go a long way toward explaining the dissatisfaction many instructors feel when they have finished grading a set of research papers and the irritation students feel when they receive a poor grade on a paper they were sure did all that a research paper is supposed to
